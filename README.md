# üìä Enterprise BI Pipeline: SSIS ETL, SSAS Cube & Power BI Dashboard

This project demonstrates a complete **Business Intelligence (BI)** workflow using the **Microsoft BI stack**, including:

- **ETL with SSIS**
- **Multidimensional modeling with SSAS**
- **Live dashboard reporting with Power BI**

It simulates a real-world scenario of turning raw data into business insights through a robust, scalable pipeline.

## üìÅ Project Workflow

### 1. ETL Process (SSIS)
- Built and deployed SSIS packages in Visual Studio to extract, clean, and transform data.
- Loaded transformed data into a SQL Server data warehouse.
- Managed different data sources (Excel, CSV, etc.).

### 2. Data Modeling (SSAS)
- Created a **multidimensional cube** using SSAS.
- Defined measures, KPIs, and hierarchies for analysis.
- Processed and deployed the cube to SQL Server.

### 3. Live Dashboard (Power BI)
- Connected Power BI to the SSAS cube via **live connection**.
- Designed an interactive dashboard with drill-downs and filters.
- Used DAX to calculate custom measures and business metrics.
